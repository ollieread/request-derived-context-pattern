# Request Scoped Context Pattern

This is a formalisation of a well-known architectural concern in web applications, where each request has a unique 
context that the application requires to function.

---

## Overview

The **Request Scoped Context** pattern defines a consistent approach to extracting, resolving, and providing access to
contextual information that is derived from the current request.
This commonly includes information such as the current user, the current tenant, or the locale.

This repository documents the pattern and its component concepts, including real-world examples and implementations, 
and sub-patterns.
